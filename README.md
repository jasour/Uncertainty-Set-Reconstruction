Reconstruction of Support of a Measure ( Uncertainty Set ) From Its Moments Information

**Description:**

Given the moment sequence of a measure µ, we find a polynomial P : R^n → R such that the set
K = {x ∈ R^n : P(x) ≥ 1} coincides with the support set of the measure µ.


**These are working notes and codes and will be updated.**
